Project Idea 4: Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Analysis
Week 1: SQL Database and Data Collection
• Tasks:
o Database Design: Design a SQL database schema for managing traffic data,
including tables for traffic sensors, traffic logs, and incidents.
o Data Collection: Simulate or use real-time traffic data to populate the
database.
o SQL Queries: Develop SQL queries for querying and summarizing traffic
data.
o Tools: Microsoft SQL Server, SQL Management Studio.
• Deliverables:
o SQL database schema and populated tables.
o SQL queries for traffic data analysis.
Week 2: Data Warehouse and Python Integration
• Tasks:
o Data Warehouse: Set up a data warehouse to handle and analyze large
volumes of traffic data.
o Data Loading: Use ETL processes to load traffic data into the warehouse.
o Python Scripting: Write Python scripts to extract traffic data, perform
preprocessing, and prepare it for analysis.
o Tools: Microsoft SQL Data Warehouse, Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy).
• Deliverables:
o Data warehouse setup and integrated traffic data.
o Python scripts for data extraction and preprocessing.
Week 3: Traffic Analysis and Azure Services
• Tasks:
o Traffic Analysis: Perform real-time traffic analysis using Python, including
traffic flow, congestion patterns, and incident detection.
o Azure Services: Leverage Azure Data services for scalable data storage and
analysis.
o Model Development: Develop models to predict traffic congestion or
incidents.
o Tools: Python (Scikit-learn, Matplotlib), Azure Data Studio, Azure Machine
Learning.
• Deliverables:
o Traffic analysis report with insights and predictive models.
o Azure integration setup for traffic data analysis.
Week 4: MLOps and Deployment
• Tasks:
o MLOps: Use MLflow to manage and track traffic analysis models.
o Deployment: Deploy the traffic analysis model as a real-time service or
dashboard for monitoring traffic conditions.

AI & DATA SCIENCE TRACK
o Final Report and Presentation: Document the project, including
database management, data warehousing, traffic analysis, and model
deployment.
o Tools: MLflow, Azure services, web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Streamlit).
• Deliverables:
o Deployed traffic analysis model or dashboard.
o Final project report and presentation.
